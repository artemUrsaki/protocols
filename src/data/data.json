These characteristics make HTTP less suited for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where resource-constrained devices often require lightweight and efficient communication. Each HTTP request involves setting up a connection, which can add overhead in terms of both time and resources. Additionally, HTTP is inherently unidirectional; clients must initiate all communication, which can be inefficient for scenarios requiring real-time updates or bidirectional communication.",

It operates on a publish/subscribe model, where devices (clients) publish messages to a broker under specific topics, and other devices subscribe to those topics to receive updates. This decoupled architecture allows for efficient and flexible communication, particularly in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where devices often have limited resources and need to transmit data continuously or in real-time.",

MQTT messages are compact, consisting of minimal overhead, which reduces bandwidth consumption and improves performance on constrained networks. Additionally, MQTT supports Quality of Service (QoS) levels, allowing users to balance reliability and network efficiency based on their specific use case. For example, QoS levels can ensure that messages are delivered at least once or exactly once, depending on the desired reliability.",

Once a connection is established, devices can send and receive messages without the need to repeatedly initiate new connections, as HTTP often requires. This makes MQTT significantly more efficient in scenarios where devices need to maintain continuous communication, such as IoT sensors streaming environmental data or wearable devices reporting health metrics. Moreover, the protocol's support for retained messages and \"last will and testament\" features ensures that subscribers can receive the most recent updates even after a temporary disconnection.",
